<p> These are a series of tutorials that were initially developed for teaching introductory bioinformatics classes at Virginia Tech. Over time they have grown to include smaller protocols used in the Aylward lab group.

<p> The "chapters" or tutorials below are intended for use at the introductory level (i.e., starting with little or no bioinformatics knowledge). They presume access to a Unix environment and have been tested on  Ubuntu or CentOS systems. <br/>

<h3> How to use these tutorials </h2>
<p> The first ~10 or so tutorials are ordered logically, with each building on methods/tools introduced in previous sections. 
  It is therefore best for those just starting in bioinformatics to start from the beginning and progress gradually. 
  Some of the tutorials only have GitHub markdown sheets with instructions, and they can be followed in the command line with no prior setup required. 
  Others have additional files that are needed to complete the tutorials; for these it is best to download the tutorial folder/directory and run the code there. 
  As an example...
