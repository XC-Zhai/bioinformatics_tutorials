<p> These are a series of tutorials that were initially developed for teaching introductory bioinformatics classes at Virginia Tech. Over time they have grown to include smaller protocols used in the Aylward lab group.

<p> The "chapters" or tutorials below are intended for use at the introductory level (i.e., starting with little or no bioinformatics knowledge). They presume access to a Unix environment and have been tested on  Ubuntu or CentOS systems. <br/>
