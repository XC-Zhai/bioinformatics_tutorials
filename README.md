# Bioinformatics tutorials
<br/><br/>

Currently in development!
<br/><br/>

These are a series of bionformatics tutorials I have developed, primarily for teaching Systems Biology 3036 at Virginia Tech and also for archiving smaller protocols used in my lab group.<br/><br/>

The "chapters" or tutorials below are intended for use at the introductory level (i.e., little or no bioinformatics knowledge). They presume a Unix or Unix-like environment (primarily Ubuntu or CentOS). <br/><br/>

### Main chapters

[Introduction to Unix](1_introduction_to_unix/introduction_to_unix.md)

[Parsing FASTA files](2_parsing_fasta_files/parsing_fasta_files.md)

[Gene Prediction](3_Gene_Prediction/Gene_Prediction.md)

<br/><br/>

### Miscellaneous

Mummer plots and whole-genome alignment
ANI and AAI
